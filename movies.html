                    Starr Carter, 16, lives between two very different worlds: she comes from a poor residential area mainly inhabited by blacks, 
                    but attends a private school for privileged students, mostly white.
                    When one day she sees her best friend Khalil being killed in front of her eyes without reason by a white policeman, 
                    all the efforts she has made so far to adapt in these two very antagonistic worlds are reduced to nothing. 
                    As pressure is exerted on her from all sides to keep silent about what she has seen, 
                    Starr faces a cruel dilemma: to remain silent to preserve his life, or to defend the rights of his friend and community.<br>

                    Robert Neville was a world-class scientist, but it would have taken more to stop the ravages of this incurable and terrifying human-made virus. 
                    Mysteriously immune to evil, Neville is now the last man to haunt the ruins of New York. Maybe the last man on Earth... 
                    For the past three years, it has been broadcasting radio broadcasts every day in the hopes of finding more survivors. 
                    No one has responded yet.<br>
                    But Neville is not alone. Mutants, victims of this modern plague (they are called the "Infected") lurk in the darkness... watch his every move, watch for his first mistake.
                    Having become humanity’s ultimate hope, Neville dedicates himself entirely to his mission: to overcome the virus, to cancel its terrible effects by using his own blood.<br>
                    Will his countless enemies give him time? The countdown is coming to an end...<br>
