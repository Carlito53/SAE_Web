      <h2><b>Presentation</b></h2>
      Hello,
      My name is Carl, I am 18 years old. I am the eldest of three brothers. <br>
      I have been passionate about computers since I was 11 years old.
    </li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li id="Special_event_in_my_life">
      <h2><b>Special event in my life</b></h2>
      Since my childhood, I lived in Puteaux in the Hauts de Seine. In 2016, we went to New Caledonia where we lived for two years. 
      During our stay, I was able to make several exchanges with correspondents and go alone to New Zealand.<br>
      In addition, we spent 4 weeks of holidays traveling the two islands. These exchanges allowed me to open up to other cultures, values and improve my English. It was a rich experience. <br>      En août 2018, nous avons quitté l'île pour retourner en métropole. A cause du décalage de l'année scolaire de la Nouvelle Calédonie (rentrée en février) et faute de place dans mon département 
      I had to integrate the second one with the absence of the last trimester of third and ten days after the start of the school year, which did not prevent me from catching up and integrating without too many difficulties.    </li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li id="Why_IT">
      <h2><b>Why IT?</b></h2>
      Why the computer? Because I fell into it when I was little. 😂<br>
      I don’t really know how to describe it, but since I was very young, I’ve been interested in how everything around me works.<br>
      When I was 11, I disassembled our broken TV to see how it worked from the inside.<br>
      When I was younger, I used to watch my dad play on his computer. I have always been surrounded by computers everywhere, internet, wifi, computers, televisions, phones ...<br>
      Then, little by little, I developed an interest in code thanks to video games and I started by modifying Java Script, making small programs arduinos, creating game servers.<br>
      In addition, I had the chance to carry out my observation internship of 3rd in Nouméa in a start-up web development and application for companies.<br>
      This is how I was able to follow my internship manager in his daily life, such as during an intervention in a company where it was necessary to modify an accounting software that was in euros and convert it into Pacific Francs.<br>
      This immersion allowed me to confirm my interest for IT.<br>
      I am also on different sharing platforms where I provide advice in computer science. This is how I was able to help people with their PC, tablet... at their home.<br>
      This is how computer science came to me quite naturally and why I chose it for my future.
    </li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li id="Why_STI2D_SIN">
      <h2><b>Why STI2D SIN?</b></h2>
      In year 10, a counselor came from the neighbouring high school to introduce us to the different courses offered to us. That’s when I heard about STI2D. At that time, my choice was made for me.<br>
      At the end of my first year of STI2D, I chose the SIN option because that’s what I was most interested in.<br>
      To be honest, I didn’t initially choose STI2D for its sustainable development part, but I learned a lot and for our future the technologies can’t be done without it.<br>
      This is what brought me to STI2D SIN.
    </li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li id="My_future_plans">
      <h2><b>My future plans</b></h2>
      Obviously my future projects have a link with computer science and programming. And now more specifically with Network, Telecommunication and Cybersecurity.<br>
      What I would like more than anything is to work in cybersecurity for a private company or for the state.<br>
      Otherwise I would like to integrate a web development or application company.<br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li id="My_personality">
      <h2><b>My personality</b></h2>
      It’s always quite complicated to talk about yourself... 🤔<br>
      I really get involved in projects and I often devote my free time to them.<br>
      I don’t hesitate to ask questions and do research. I quickly understand things.<br>
      I can be messy sometimes, but when it comes to computers I become a storage maniac. Each file has a place and everything has to be stored and sorted. In this way, I am organized in my work.<br>
      I integrate easily into a group and I am rather appreciated by my comrades.<br>
      I enjoy listening to music when I work, especially when I do programming.<br>
      My strong point: always smiling!   (except when I’m focused)
